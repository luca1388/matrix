# Matrix

## About this project
This is a simple example to demonstrate how to use P5.js library to create graphical projects using Javascript. In particular this script prints a source code simulation of the famous [Matrix](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/) movie. You can see it in action [here](https://master.d1iy52s0nx71wy.amplifyapp.com/).
